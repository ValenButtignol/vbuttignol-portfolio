      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello! my name is Valentin, a passionate software engineer with a devotion for  to creating clean, scalable, and efficient software pieces.</p>
      <p>My journey into development started in university, where I discovered my passion for backend systems and how they power everything users see. Since then, I've worked on projects ranging from carpooling platforms to AI-assisted testing tools, learning how to design systems that scale and make sense.</p>
      <p>I enjoy working across the stack, but my heart is in backend development. I seek to become a world-class expert in engineering with clean software design overall, but especifically on topics like distributed systems, AI/ML or cybersecurity. I'm currently helping improve a real-world carpooling app at CityPooling, while continuing to explore these subjects.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tech ideas, reading about system design, or experimenting with AI-driven tools.</p>
